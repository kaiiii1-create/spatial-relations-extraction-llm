Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to Pooley Bridge, where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired. A fine view may be had from the top of Dunmallet, on which are the vestiges of a Roman fort. There is some good fishing here in the lake and stream. Trout, perch, and eels, are numerous, and large lake-trout are sometimes, though seldom, taken. Lowther Castle, the seat of the Earl of Lonsdale, is distant from this bridge about four miles. Ulleswater is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by Hallen Fell, on the western shore. The second is ter-



minated by Stybarrow Crag on the east, with Helvellyn towering in the distance behind it, and Birk Fell on the west. The third reach is decidedly the most beautiful, being surrounded by towering mountains, and studded with little islands, which, combined with the woods and rich vegetation, present a magnificent scene. The view in our engraving is taken from Birk Fell, having Stybarrow Crag on the right. After leaving Pooley Bridge, the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of Watermillock, it improves rapidly. About a mile beyond Halsteads, the road enters Gowbarrow Park, formerly the hunting seat of the Duke of Norfolk, now the property of Mr. Howards of Greystoke. It is of great size, and is filled with beautiful groups of trees, among which may be seen herds of fallow-deer, whose presence give the additional charm of wilderness to the scene.

The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable.

About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere.

By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage.

The circuit of Keswick lake is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence. The best views of it are to be had from Crow Park, Friar's Crag, and the Vicarage. The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of Derwentwater to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, and is connected with Borrowdale on the south, and Thirlmere on the east, while on the west is Newlands Vale. Castlehill, one mile from Keswick on the Ambleside road, and Ashness, afford good bird's-eye views, while more distant views may be had from Latrigg, Ormathwaite, Applethwaite, and Braithwaite.

There is a cleft in Wallow Crag called the Lady's Rake, from the circumstance of the Countess of Derwentwater having escaped up this gorge when her husband was arrested for high treason. About two miles from Keswick is Barrow House, embosomed in very fine trees.
