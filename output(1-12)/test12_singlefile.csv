There are many objects of interest in and around the town, the chief of which are, the ruins of the castle - the church-yard, in which is a curious ancient monument called the



Giant's Grave;- the Beacon, from the top of which the view of some of the distant lakes is very fine and extensive;- the Giant's Caves, and a group of curious stones called Long Meg and her Daughters. At Old Penrith are the remains of a Roman station, and the seats of the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood are numerous.",ancient town,in the south of,the county of Cumberland
Anon1857_b.xml,5,"From Penrith two roads lead to Pooley Bridge, about six miles distant, which spans the Eamont just at its issue from Ulleswater. Either road may be taken, be we recommend that which follows the Shap road to Eamont Bridge. Carleton Hall is near to it on the left. Cross the bridge, and take the first road to the right. At this point, on the left, are the druidical remains called King Arthur's Round Table, and Mayborough. Immediately after crossing Pooley Bridge, the road runs along the western shore of",Carleton Hall,near to,the Shap road
Anon1857_b.xml,6,"To Patterdale, a distance of ten miles; but, before proceeding along it, the tourist would do well to take a walk of a few miles along the eastern shore, in the direction of Martindale, from several points on which he will obtain a good view of the lake. Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to Pooley Bridge, where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired. A fine view may be had from the top of Dunmallet, on which are the vestiges of a Roman fort. There is some good fishing here in the lake and stream. Trout, perch, and eels, are numerous, and large lake-trout are sometimes, though seldom, taken. Lowther Castle, the seat of the Earl of Lonsdale, is distant from this bridge about four miles. Ulleswater is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by Hallen Fell, on the western shore. The second is ter-



minated by Stybarrow Crag on the east, with Helvellyn towering in the distance behind it, and Birk Fell on the west. The third reach is decidedly the most beautiful, being surrounded by towering mountains, and studded with little islands, which, combined with the woods and rich vegetation, present a magnificent scene. The view in our engraving is taken from Birk Fell, having Stybarrow Crag on the right. After leaving Pooley Bridge, the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of Watermillock, it improves rapidly. About a mile beyond Halsteads, the road enters Gowbarrow Park, formerly the hunting seat of the Duke of Norfolk, now the property of Mr. Howards of Greystoke. It is of great size, and is filled with beautiful groups of trees, among which may be seen herds of fallow-deer, whose presence give the additional charm of wilderness to the scene. Lyulph's Tower, which stands on an eminence here, is a picturesque object; and there are many exquisite ""bits"" of minute scenery, clad with luxuriant verdure, that will delight the eye of a painter. From Lyulph's Tower, a delightful walk runs up a rocky vale to a waterfall called",Hallen Fell,closed in by,the first reach of Ulleswater
Anon1857_b.xml,7,"This is a beautiful fall. It leaps from the top of a wooded cliff, through a narrow gorge, and descends a sheer perpendicular height of eighty feet. The roar of the falling waters, and the descending of spray, add to the feelings of romance created by the view of rugged rocks, thickly planted trees, and hanging verdure, which characterize the spot. At the upper end of the park the last reach of the lake opens up the view, in a majestic sweep round the mountains on the opposite side. The shores are bold, covered partly with wood, and indented with bays. The road now passes under Sty-



barrow Crag, which raises its broken and scarred front on the right, while a steep bank descends into the deep waters of the lake on the left, and, winding round the head of Ulleswater, it conducts to the village of",the road,passes under,Stybarrow Crag
Anon1857_b.xml,8,"Where there is a good inn, at which boats and guides may be procured. Some time ought to be spent here in visiting the beautiful scenes in the vicinity. Among these are,- the little islands at the head of the lake, in visiting which a day might be pleasantly whiled away. Some of the best views on the shores of Ulleswater are to be had from the lake itself, by rowing past the islands called Cherry Holme and House Holme, and approaching towards Stybarrow Crag. Helvellyn stand between four and five miles from the village. By ascending it, the visitor will be amply repaid for his toil by a magnificent, map-like view of the lake district. The mountain is 3055 feet above the sea-level, but is easy of ascent, and ponies can be taken to the top. There are two ways of approach from Patterdale; the best is by Glenridding. This valley is traversed by a stream, which ought to be followed to its source in the Red Tarn, lying a few hundred feet below the top of the mountain. The south-east boundary of the Tarn is a ridge of rock called Striding Edge, and the north-west is another ridge called Swirrel Edge. The latter must be followed, as striding edge is exceedingly dangerous. There is a spring, called Brownrigg's Well, not more than 300 yards from the summit of the mountain, on the south-west side. For a short ramble, the Place Fell Quarry, half a mile from the inn, may be visited, as it affords a good view of Ulleswater: and the valley of Martindale exhibits some beautiful scenery. There is a mountain called High Street, little more than four miles distant from the inn; but he who ascends Helvellyn need not waste time in scaling this mountain, which is 2700 feet height, and de-



rives its name from a road which the Romans constructed over it. Fro Patterdale, also, a detour may be made on foot across the Martindale Fells to",Helvellyn,stand between,four and five miles from the village
Anon1857_b.xml,10,"Or, if time cannot be afforded to do so, the lake may be seen while travelling to Ambleside (which is ten miles from Patterdale), and especially from Kirkstone Pass, over which the road runs to Ambleside. The view here is exceedingly fine, and when lighted up by the slanting rays of the sun, and glowing in the garb and glory of an autumnal evening, it must be quite magnificent. From this point, however, the view of Brothers Water is somewhat distant. The lake is a large tarn, deriving its name from the circumstance of two brothers having been drowned there. Before leaving this scene, much enjoyment may be derived from a visit to the beautiful valley of Deepdale, which runs up into the mountains from Bridge End, two miles from Patterdale.



Just beyond this bridge is a splendid view of the surrounding country. Dodd, with its sloping sides, Kidsty Pike, Grey Crag, part of Placefell and Colddale Crags are on the east of the road; and to the west are Dodd Bield, the Screes, Low-wood on the borders of Bothers Water, &c. Hartsope should also be visited for beautiful scenery. Kirkstone Pass derives its name from a large stone at the head of the pass, which bears a fancied resemblance to a church. There is a small inn here; and at this point the road to Troutbeck turns to the left. Windermere is seen on descending the pass, and three miles beyond lies the village of",Kirkstone Pass,runs to,Ambleside

Visitors usually view it from the top of the bank, which is the worst position in which any fall can be seen. By a little



scrambling, however, the view presented in our engraving may be obtained. This fall being easy of access, will naturally engage the visitors attention first. Afterwards he will visit",visitors,view,top of the bank
Anon1857_b.xml,13,"This is the largest of all the English lakes, but the character of the scenery is not so grand as that of the others. The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it. Strangers are allowed to land and walk among the groves and woods with which abounds, and, as plants and underwood are luxuriant, it presents a rich field of research to the botanist. From its upper end the prospect is very fine, embracing the head of the lake with its bays and wooded promontories; its islands and its back ground of mountains, - the Kentmore range, High Street, Wansfield Pike, Hill-Bell, Fairfield and Rydal Nab. The islands in view are Hen Holm, and Lady Holm. There is a point just behind the Ferry Inn which ought to be visited, as a fine view of the surrounding scenery may be obtained from it.",the river Leven,falls into,the estuary called the Leven Sands
Anon1857_b.xml,15,"At the ferry near Bowness, about the year 1635, a marriage party was crossing in a boat, when one of those squalls, to which Windermere is rather liable, upset the boat, and all its occupants, about fifty in number, including the bride and bridegroom, were drowned.",the boat,near,Bowness
Anon1857_b.xml,16,"A branch from the Lancaster and Carlisle railway conducts from Kendal to Birthwaite, a mile to the north of Bowness, and near the shores of the lake. From the station here coaches run to Ambleside and Keswick, Hawkshead and Coniston; and the mail goes daily to Cockermouth, from which there is a railway to Whitehaven. The numerous elegant villas, and picturesque cottages, which nestle amid the luxuriant woodlands, and cover the verdant slopes and shores of Windermere, add greatly to the richness of the landscape. Besides the stations already mentioned, Ferry Inn, on the promontory over against Bowness, and Newby Bridge at the foot of the lake, afford good accommodation, guides and boats, to the tourist.",Bowness,to the north of,Birthwaite
Anon1857_b.xml,17,"In the route we have laid down, Coniston Water and Esthwaite Lake are omitted, neither of them being equal to the other scenery of the lake district; but, for the benefit of the tourist who has much time on his hands, we subjoin a brief outline of these lakes and their environs.",Coniston Water,and,Esthwaite Lake
Anon1857_b.xml,20,"Or Thurston Lake, is six miles in length, and nearly a mile in breadth. The village of Coniston is pleasantly situated under a hill on the west side of the water. Coniston hall, an ancient building, is also on this side of the lake, and cottages are thinly scattered over the heights that encircle its head. A pleasant road runs through the margin, sometimes passing through groves and coppices, at other times crossing over open ground and commanding a fine prospect. At the north-west angle of the lake, near its outlet, rises the Old Man Mountain, the ascent of which should be made, as it commands an extensive prospect towards the south and west,



while in other directions it is surrounded by the frowning heights of the neighbouring mountains. The Old Man is the highest peak of the Coniston Fell range, and is about 2580 feet high. In very clear weather, the Isle of Man may be seen from its summit. It consists chiefly of slate, which being admirably adapted for roofing, is excavated in large quantities. Besides this there are extensive copper mines situated about half way up the hill, into which they penetrate horizontally for half a mile, while the shafts are upwards of two hundred yards deep. Great numbers of people are employed in the working of those mines which belong to Lady Le Fleming of Rydal Hall, who is also proprietor of the slate quarries. At a village called Low Nibthwaite, near Lowick Bridge, where the lake terminates in the Crake rivulet, there is an iron forge. The feeders of Coniston Water are, Black Beck and Coniston Beck, and the charr in the lake are said to be the finest in England. In ascending the Old Man, start from the village at its base and follow the road leading to the copper mines. At the distance of half a mile from the village is a foot-bridge over the stream, which must be crossed; after this the traveller may be left to find his way to the top. Instead of returning to Ambleside by the same road, through Hawkshead, the pedestrian may take the road leading from Waterhead Inn through Yewdale, which, at little more than three miles distant, joins the Little Langdale road at a point about three miles from Ambleside. Walks and excursions around Ambleside are innumerable and full of interest. We can only enumerate a few of them.",Coniston,situated under,a hill
Anon1857_b.xml,21,"Of which Great Langdale is the finer. If the tourist desires to visit both Langdales let him go by Clappersgate, along the banks of the Brathay. About three miles from Ambleside there is a fall of about twenty feet in height, which is embosomed in remarkably fine scenery. It is a little above



Skelwith Bridge. About a mile further on, the road re-crosses the stream at Colwith Bridge, above which there is another fell named Colwith Force, about seventy feet in height. It is in a dell close to the road. A short distance farther on is Little Langdale Tarn, after which the road diverging to the right ascends into a solitary scene, in the midst of which is Blea Tarn, and thence descends into Great Langdale. At a farm house called Mill Beck refreshment can be obtained. Langdale pikes may be ascended, and Dungeon Gill Force visited. Over this fall there is a natural bridge of which Wordsworth writes:",Colwith Bridge,above,Colwith Force
Anon1857_b.xml,22,"There are two roads through Great Langdale by which to return. The one near the hills on the left is to be preferred by pedestrians; the other is more suitable for carriages, and both pass through lovely scenery. They separate at the chapel a mile and a half from Mill Beck. The first conducts by Grasmere and Rydalmere to the Keswick road; the other, passing Elter Water, Loughrigg Fell and Tarn, joins the Clappersgate road. The whole walk, by either way, from Ambleside to Dungeon Gill Force and back, is not more than seventeen or eighteen miles.",the first,conducts by,Grasmere and Rydalmere

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage. From Rydal Mount, a footpath passes under Knab Scar, and rejoins the main road at White Moss Quarry. From this walk many charming views may be had of the scenery around Rydal Lake, which is eminently beautiful. Near White Moss Quarry, there are two old roads to",Rydal Mount,on,the hill called Knab Scar

Anon1857_b.xml,29,"Lying between Helm Crag and Silver How, is extremely picturesque. Being elevated above Grasmere, the ascent affords many fine prospects of the valley. About a mile and a half up the vale is a small cascade, called Sour Milk Gill, on a stream which issues from a large tarn, less than half a mile further up. Beyond this there is another tarn, named Coddale; and further on, to the left, is a third, called Stickle Tarn, where trout fishing is good. It lies at the foot of Langdale Pikes, about three miles from Grasmere. Those who are fond of climbing can ascend the Pikes from this valley, or cross the Coddale Fell, into Borrowdale. One of the summits of Langdale Pikes is 2400 feet high, and is named Harrison Stickle; the other, 2300 feet, is called Pike o' Stickle. From either of these tops the view is very fine, embracing, of course, all that has been already seen from



the summit of Helm Crag. The highest peak has the most extensive range, including part of the distant sea. The Pikes are usually ascended from Langdale; but, if the present route be adopted, it will be found more convenient and agreeable every way to ascend them from Easdale.",Stickle Tarn,lies at the foot of,Langdale Pikes

Our drawing gives the lake, with Saddleback immediately behind it, - Eagle Crag on the left, and Helvellyn filling up the right of the picture. The main road is rejoined at Southwaite Moss, about four miles from Keswick; but, if the tourist be a pedestrian, he will find a much more agreeable route, by proceeding from this point down the beautiful vale of St. John's, by which deviation the road will be lengthened by little more than a mile. About a mile from Keswick, on the main road, there is an eminence called Castlerigg, from the top of which can be enjoyed one of the finest scenes in the district.",Saddleback,behind,the lake
Anon1857_b.xml,33,"From Grasmere to Keswick is little more than twelve miles by the direct road; but for those who disdain distance and fatigue, we cannot too strongly recommend a deviation from the highway into the mountain tracks. Start from Grasmere, pass the western side of Helm Crag, and go up the valley of Easdale; a somewhat laborious climb conducts to a level track called Coddale Fell; cross this, and descend by Stonethwaite and Borrowdale, and so on to Keswick. This route is about twenty miles long, but the difference in distance is more than compensated for by the exhilarating air of the hill-sides, and the commanding views of the surrounding country.",Grasmere,to,Keswick
Anon1857_b.xml,34,"The tourist ought to make this town his head-quarters for some time, in order to explore and enjoy thoroughly the beauties of the surrounding district. Besides the hotels noted above, there are several excellent inns, where boats,



guides, and all requisites for the comfort and convenience of the traveller are to be had. Should he determine upon spending some time in the vicinity, good board and lodging may be obtained at reasonable terms. Keswick is a little market-town, consisting of one large street, situate in a fine fertile valley on the south bank of the Greta, at the foot of Skiddaw, and half a mile from Derwent Water. Bassenthwaite Mere is also in the vicinity; it is connected by a river with the former lake; and the whole of the charming landscape is studded with villages and detached cottages, embosomed among the richest verdure. There are about 2000 inhabitants in the town, who are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the linsey-woolsey stuffs and black lead pencils, the lead for which is procured in the mines of Borrowdale. The chief points of interest in and near the town are, the town-hall, erected in 1813; the parish church, upwards of half a mile distant, in which lie the remains of Dr. Southey; and the new church, an elegant building, standing on an eminence at the south end of the town, which commands a fine view of the surrounding country. There are two museums, kept by Messrs. Crosthwaite and Hutton, which ought to be visited, as they contain many curiosities and interesting specimens of the products of the neighbourhood. There is a remarkably fine model of the lake district, exhibited by its ingenious constructor, which deserves a visit, as it is wonderfully minute and correct, and coloured according to nature. It is on the scale of three inches to the mile. There is an old bell here, which has the letters H. D. R. O. 1001, stamped on it. Great Hall, the residence of the late Dr. Southey, stands on an eminence not far from the town.

It is about three miles long by upwards of a mile broad, and lies within an amphitheatre of rocky, broken, picturesque mountains and precipices, whose peaks, lights, shadows, and wooded eminences are reflected from waters of peculiar clearness and considerable depth. Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene. The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The circuit of Keswick lake is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence. The best views of it are to be had from Crow Park, Friar's Crag, and the Vicarage. The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of Derwentwater to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, and is connected with Borrowdale on the south, and Thirlmere on the east, while on the west is Newlands Vale. Castlehill, one mile from Keswick on the Ambleside road, and Ashness, afford good bird's-eye views, while more distant views may be had from Latrigg, Ormathwaite, Applethwaite, and Braithwaite.

road, passing on the left Castle Head, Wallow Crag, and Falcon Crag. There is a cleft in Wallow Crag called the Lady's Rake, from the circumstance of the Countess of Derwentwater having escaped up this gorge when her husband was arrested for high treason. About two miles from Keswick is Barrow House, embosomed in very fine trees. There is a pretty cascade, upwards of 100 feet high, in the grounds, which is shown to the strangers on application at the lodge. A mile beyond this is the celebrated fall of",Wallow Crag,on the left,Castle Head

The stream falls through a chasm between the two immense upright rocks of Gowdar Crag on the left, and Shepherd's Crag on the right. Its height is about 150 feet, and its rocky sides are covered with clinging trees and pendant herbage. Southey notices this fall in an amusing piece, which, as it were, lays bare the inexhaustible fountain whence the poet's numbers flowed. Our space will not admit of more than the following extract:-",the stream,falls through,a chasm between the two immense upright rocks of Gowdar Crag and Shepherd's Crag

From the top of the cascade there is a very fine view of Derwentwater and Skiddaw. When flooded by rains, and swelled by the tributary waters of a thousand mountain rills, Lodore becomes truly magnificent. The tremendous roar of the rushing water, as it dashes from rock to rock, and leaps in white foam impetuously along its rugged course, is so loud, that it can be heard at a distance of nine or ten miles, in calm weather. Those who possess an adventurous spirit will find the rocky scenery in this neighbourhood worthy of being clambered over, even at the risk of a few sprains and bruises!

bourhood, who thought that he could improve upon nature, committed some depredations on the native simplicity of this rock and its locality; among other things he erected a ladder against the side of the rock, to enable aspiring strangers to reach the top of it. No good was gained by this, as the view is not nearly equal to that which may be obtained from any of the adjacent heights, while the rude wooden structure spoils the rugged outline of the stone. Just opposite to Bowder Stone, Castle Crag rears its head. Its name is derived from a Roman fortress which once crowned its summit, and guarded the pass of Borrowdale. The views from this mount are grand and extensive. On one side are Derwentwater; its wooded islands, and the rich vale, speckled with human habitations, and mingled field and woodland scenery, with Skiddaw for a background.

At Peel Wyke there is a small tavern, and a little beyond it the road diverges to the right, where a guide-post directs to Ouse Bridge. This bridge spans the Derwent at its source. From this point, and at Armathwaite, a little farther on, the best views are to be had. A little beyond this is Castle Inn, from which to Keswick is eight miles, by the northern shore of the lake.

In the midst of this valley is the celebrated rock mentioned by Sir Walter Scott in his Bridal of Triermain. It bears a striking resemblance to an old castle standing on the summit of a slight elevation.

To reach it, proceed along the Borrowdale road, past Wallow Crag, towards Barrow House, behind which the road runs towards a pretty tarn, out of which the stream which forms Lodore waterfall issues. A rustic bridge crosses the stream here. The walk may be prolonged, if desired, over the Wythburn Fells to Thirlmere.

It s 3160 feet above the sea, and commands, of course, a most extensive view of all the mountains and valleys of the district for many miles around; including Morecambe Bay and the Welsh Highlands to the south, and the Irish Sea along the western horizon, while the prospect is bounded in the north by the blue mountains of Scotland. In clear weather the Isle of Man can be seen. The best point for commencing the ascent is from Strands, at the foot of Wast Water.",Wast Water,at the foot of,Strands
Anon1857_b.xml,51,"There are many delightful short walks about Keswick, which the tourist will easily discover, by a survey of the country from its various heights. Among them are Castle Head, or, as the inhabitants call it, Castlet, one mile from the town. Friars Crag, a promontory stretching out into the lake, of which it commands a fine view, and also a distant one of Lodore; and a walk to the Druidical circle, already alluded to.

Anon1857_b.xml,52,"There are two roads to this lake, both of which are interesting; but only one admits of carriage travelling. We shall describe it first. Passing the village of Portinscale, the road runs between Foe Park Woods and Swinside to the Three



Road Ends. Take the one on the right, which, skirting Swinside, leads through Newlands to Buttermere. The scenery along this road is fine, particularly at a mountain called Rawling End. Just after passing Keskadale, the road ascends abruptly to Newland's Haws, after passing which it runs at a great height above the ravine, between it and the opposite hill. The view in this descent is magnificent, comprehending an immense range of mountains. The road passes a small chapel, near to which is the inn famous as being the residence of Mary Robinson, the Beauty of Buttermere. Mary's history is briefly as follows:- She was the daughter of the innkeeper, whose house was not a little indebted for its custom to the attractions of Mary. Of course she had many wooers, but rejected them all in favour of a man named Hatfield, who gave himself out to be Colonel Hope. This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged. Poor May remained an interesting young widow in her native valley for some time after this, and became famous in consequence of the reports of tourists regarding her beauty; but ultimately she became unromantic enough to marry a respectable farmer of Calbeck. She dies a few years ago.",the road,runs between,Foe Park Woods and Swinside
Anon1857_b.xml,54,"One of the highest waterfalls in the country, is on the opposite side of the lake. A footpath, leading over the ground that divides the two lakes, conducts to it; but the tourist had better go by boat from the head of Crummock Water, as the footpath is disagreeably dirty in wet weather. The fall is a mile from the landing-place. It is 160 feet high, and descends between two immense perpendicular walls of rock. From a point a little above the promontory, called Ling Crag, is obtained the best view of",the highest waterfalls,on the opposite side of,the lake
