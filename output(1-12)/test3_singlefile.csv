THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn.

Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake.

As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason.

two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals.

Anon1857_b.xml,26,"And Grasmere, now claim our attention. The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views.

It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage. From Rydal Mount, a footpath passes under Knab Scar, and rejoins the main road at White Moss Quarry.

The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842.

Road Ends. Take the one on the right, which, skirting Swinside, leads through Newlands to Buttermere. The scenery along this road is fine, particularly at a mountain called Rawling End. Just after passing Keskadale, the road ascends abruptly to Newland's Haws, after passing which it runs at a great height above the ravine, between it and the opposite hill. The view in this descent is magnificent, comprehending an immense range of mountains. The road passes a small chapel, near to which is the inn famous as being the residence of Mary Robinson, the Beauty of Buttermere. Mary's history is briefly as follows:- She was the daughter of the innkeeper, whose house was not a little indebted for its custom to the attractions of Mary. Of course she had many wooers, but rejected them all in favour of a man named Hatfield, who gave himself out to be Colonel Hope. This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged. Poor May remained an interesting young widow in her native valley for some time after this, and became famous in consequence of the reports of tourists regarding her beauty; but ultimately she became unromantic enough to marry a respectable farmer of Calbeck. She dies a few years ago.",road,runs between,Foe Park Woods and Swinside
