He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the



mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.



THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

Among these are,- the little islands at the head of the lake, in visiting which a day might be pleasantly whiled away. Some of the best views on the shores of Ulleswater are to be had from the lake itself, by rowing past the islands called Cherry Holme and House Holme, and approaching towards Stybarrow Crag. Helvellyn stand between four and five miles from the village. By ascending it, the visitor will be amply repaid for his toil by a magnificent, map-like view of the lake district. The mountain is 3055 feet above the sea-level, but is easy of ascent, and ponies can be taken to the top. There are two ways of approach from Patterdale; the best is by Glenridding. This valley is traversed by a stream, which ought to be followed to its source in the Red Tarn, lying a few hundred feet below the top of the mountain. The south-east boundary of the Tarn is a ridge of rock called Striding Edge, and the north-west is another ridge called Swirrel Edge. The latter must be followed, as striding edge is exceedingly dangerous. There is a spring, called Brownrigg's Well, not more than 300 yards from the summit of the mountain, on the south-west side. For a short ramble, the Place Fell Quarry, half a mile from the inn, may be visited, as it affords a good view of Ulleswater: and the valley of Martindale exhibits some beautiful scenery. There is a mountain called High Street, little more than four miles distant from the inn; but he who ascends Helvellyn need not waste time in scaling this mountain, which is 2700 feet height, and de-



rives its name from a road which the Romans constructed over it. Fro Patterdale, also, a detour may be made on foot across the Martindale Fells to",spring,on,south-west side

Anon1857_b.xml,13,"This is the largest of all the English lakes, but the character of the scenery is not so grand as that of the others. The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it. Strangers are allowed to land and walk among the groves and woods with which abounds, and, as plants and underwood are luxuriant, it presents a rich field of research to the botanist. From its upper end the prospect is very fine, embracing the head of the lake with its bays and wooded promontories; its islands and its back ground of mountains, - the Kentmore range, High Street, Wansfield Pike, Hill-Bell, Fairfield and Rydal Nab.

Coniston hall, an ancient building, is also on this side of the lake, and cottages are thinly scattered over the heights that encircle its head. A pleasant road runs through the margin, sometimes passing through groves and coppices, at other times crossing over open ground and commanding a fine prospect. At the north-west angle of the lake, near its outlet, rises the Old Man Mountain, the ascent of which should be made, as it commands an extensive prospect towards the south and west,



while in other directions it is surrounded by the frowning heights of the neighbouring mountains. The Old Man is the highest peak of the Coniston Fell range, and is about 2580 feet high. In very clear weather, the Isle of Man may be seen from its summit. It consists chiefly of slate, which being admirably adapted for roofing, is excavated in large quantities. Besides this there are extensive copper mines situated about half way up the hill, into which they penetrate horizontally for half a mile, while the shafts are upwards of two hundred yards deep. Great numbers of people are employed in the working of those mines which belong to Lady Le Fleming of Rydal Hall, who is also proprietor of the slate quarries.

Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on

It is about three miles long by upwards of a mile broad, and lies within an amphitheatre of rocky, broken, picturesque mountains and precipices, whose peaks, lights, shadows, and wooded eminences are reflected from waters of peculiar clearness and considerable depth. Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene. The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The circuit of Keswick lake is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence.
