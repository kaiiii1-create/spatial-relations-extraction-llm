He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads.

mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required.

THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to Pooley Bridge, where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired.

The mountain is 3055 feet above the sea-level, but is easy of ascent, and ponies can be taken to the top. There are two ways of approach from Patterdale; the best is by Glenridding. This valley is traversed by a stream, which ought to be followed to its source in the Red Tarn, lying a few hundred feet below the top of the mountain. The south-east boundary of the Tarn is a ridge of rock called Striding Edge, and the north-west is another ridge called Swirrel Edge. The latter must be followed, as striding edge is exceedingly dangerous. There is a spring, called Brownrigg's Well, not more than 300 yards from the summit of the mountain, on the south-west side. For a short ramble, the Place Fell Quarry, half a mile from the inn, may be visited, as it affords a good view of Ulleswater: and the valley of Martindale exhibits some beautiful scenery. There is a mountain called High Street, little more than four miles distant from the inn; but he who ascends Helvellyn need not waste time in scaling this mountain, which is 2700 feet height, and de-

The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn.

A short distance farther on is Little Langdale Tarn, after which the road diverging to the right ascends into a solitary scene, in the midst of which is Blea Tarn, and thence descends into Great Langdale. At a farm house called Mill Beck refreshment can be obtained. Langdale pikes may be ascended, and Dungeon Gill Force visited. Over this fall there is a natural bridge of which Wordsworth writes:",the fall,is over,a natural bridge

Anon1857_b.xml,26,"And Grasmere, now claim our attention. The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views.

It is about two miles from the inn to the top, and it has a curious formation of broken rocks on its summit, which has been compared by Wordsworth to an old woman seated on the crag. The view from this crag embraces the whole of the vale of Grasmere, Helvellyn, Dunmail Raise, Wansfell Pike, Saddleback, Langdale Pikes, Windermere, Esthwaite Water, and the Coniston range.

Should he determine upon spending some time in the vicinity, good board and lodging may be obtained at reasonable terms. Keswick is a little market-town, consisting of one large street, situate in a fine fertile valley on the south bank of the Greta, at the foot of Skiddaw, and half a mile from Derwent Water. Bassenthwaite Mere is also in the vicinity; it is connected by a river with the former lake; and the whole of the charming landscape is studded with villages and detached cottages, embosomed among the richest verdure. There are about 2000 inhabitants in the town, who are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the linsey-woolsey stuffs and black lead pencils, the lead for which is procured in the mines of Borrowdale. The chief points of interest in and near the town are, the town-hall, erected in 1813; the parish church, upwards of half a mile distant, in which lie the remains of Dr. Southey; and the new church, an elegant building, standing on an eminence at the south end of the town, which commands a fine view of the surrounding country. There are two museums, kept by Messrs. Crosthwaite and Hutton, which ought to be visited, as they contain many curiosities and interesting specimens of the products of the neighbourhood. There is a remarkably fine model of the lake district, exhibited by its ingenious constructor, which deserves a visit, as it is wonderfully minute and correct, and coloured according to nature. It is on the scale of three inches to the mile. There is an old bell here, which has the letters H. D. R. O. 1001, stamped on it. Great Hall, the residence of the late Dr. Southey, stands on an eminence not far from the town. The whole neighbourhood of Keswick is extremely beautiful, and rich in tempting rambles.",Great Hall,stands on,an eminence not far from the town

It is about three miles long by upwards of a mile broad, and lies within an amphitheatre of rocky, broken, picturesque mountains and precipices, whose peaks, lights, shadows, and wooded eminences are reflected from waters of peculiar clearness and considerable depth. Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene. The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The circuit of Keswick lake is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence. The best views of it are to be had from Crow Park, Friar's Crag, and the Vicarage. The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of Derwentwater to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, and is connected with Borrowdale on the south, and Thirlmere on the east, while on the west is Newlands Vale.

The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The circuit of Keswick lake is a delightful excursion, affording many fine prospects of surpassing grandeur, wildness, and magnificence. The best views of it are to be had from Crow Park, Friar's Crag, and the Vicarage. The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of Derwentwater to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, and is connected with Borrowdale on the south, and Thirlmere on the east, while on the west is Newlands Vale. Castlehill, one mile from Keswick on the Ambleside road, and Ashness, afford good bird's-eye views, while more distant views may be had from Latrigg, Ormathwaite, Applethwaite, and Braithwaite.

bourhood, who thought that he could improve upon nature, committed some depredations on the native simplicity of this rock and its locality; among other things he erected a ladder against the side of the rock, to enable aspiring strangers to reach the top of it. No good was gained by this, as the view is not nearly equal to that which may be obtained from any of the adjacent heights, while the rude wooden structure spoils the rugged outline of the stone. Just opposite to Bowder Stone, Castle Crag rears its head. Its name is derived from a Roman fortress which once crowned its summit, and guarded the pass of Borrowdale. The views from this mount are grand and extensive. On one side are Derwentwater; its wooded islands, and the rich vale, speckled with human habitations, and mingled field and woodland scenery, with Skiddaw for a background. On the other side is the pass of Borrowdale, where the mountains are congregated in massive confusion and wild grandeur.",mountains,congregated in,massive confusion

a promontory at one end. The scenery around it is grand. Its eastern side is well wooded, while on the western side a long range of mountain slopes stretch from end to end, terminating everywhere precipitously in water.
