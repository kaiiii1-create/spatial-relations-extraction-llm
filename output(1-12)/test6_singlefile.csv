THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the



mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.



THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom. There are many routes by which the traveller may visit the lakes. That which we have selected as the groundwork of the present volume is one of the most central, and one by which all the principal lakes may be visited. It is also the best, perhaps, that can be followed by pedestrians.",lakes,may be visited by,pedestrians

Coniston hall, an ancient building, is also on this side of the lake, and cottages are thinly scattered over the heights that encircle its head. A pleasant road runs through the margin, sometimes passing through groves and coppices, at other times crossing over open ground and commanding a fine prospect. At the north-west angle of the lake, near its outlet, rises the Old Man Mountain, the ascent of which should be made, as it commands an extensive prospect towards the south and west,



while in other directions it is surrounded by the frowning heights of the neighbouring mountains. The Old Man is the highest peak of the Coniston Fell range, and is about 2580 feet high. In very clear weather, the Isle of Man may be seen from its summit. It consists chiefly of slate, which being admirably adapted for roofing, is excavated in large quantities. Besides this there are extensive copper mines situated about half way up the hill, into which they penetrate horizontally for half a mile, while the shafts are upwards of two hundred yards deep. Great numbers of people are employed in the working of those mines which belong to Lady Le Fleming of Rydal Hall, who is also proprietor of the slate quarries. At a village called Low Nibthwaite, near Lowick Bridge, where the lake terminates in the Crake rivulet, there is an iron forge. The feeders of Coniston Water are, Black Beck and Coniston Beck, and the charr in the lake are said to be the finest in England. In ascending the Old Man, start from the village at its base and follow the road leading to the copper mines. At the distance of half a mile from the village is a foot-bridge over the stream, which must be crossed; after this the traveller may be left to find his way to the top. Instead of returning to Ambleside by the same road, through Hawkshead, the pedestrian may take the road leading from Waterhead Inn through Yewdale, which, at little more than three miles distant, joins the Little Langdale road at a point about three miles from Ambleside.

while in other directions it is surrounded by the frowning heights of the neighbouring mountains. The Old Man is the highest peak of the Coniston Fell range, and is about 2580 feet high. In very clear weather, the Isle of Man may be seen from its summit. It consists chiefly of slate, which being admirably adapted for roofing, is excavated in large quantities. Besides this there are extensive copper mines situated about half way up the hill, into which they penetrate horizontally for half a mile, while the shafts are upwards of two hundred yards deep. Great numbers of people are employed in the working of those mines which belong to Lady Le Fleming of Rydal Hall, who is also proprietor of the slate quarries. At a village called Low Nibthwaite, near Lowick Bridge, where the lake terminates in the Crake rivulet, there is an iron forge. The feeders of Coniston Water are, Black Beck and Coniston Beck, and the charr in the lake are said to be the finest in England. In ascending the Old Man, start from the village at its base and follow the road leading to the copper mines. At the distance of half a mile from the village is a foot-bridge over the stream, which must be crossed; after this the traveller may be left to find his way to the top. Instead of returning to Ambleside by the same road, through Hawkshead, the pedestrian may take the road leading from Waterhead Inn through Yewdale, which, at little more than three miles distant, joins the Little Langdale road at a point about three miles from Ambleside.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on

Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene.

Road Ends. Take the one on the right, which, skirting Swinside, leads through Newlands to Buttermere. The scenery along this road is fine, particularly at a mountain called Rawling End. Just after passing Keskadale, the road ascends abruptly to Newland's Haws, after passing which it runs at a great height above the ravine, between it and the opposite hill. The view in this descent is magnificent, comprehending an immense range of mountains. The road passes a small chapel, near to which is the inn famous as being the residence of Mary Robinson, the Beauty of Buttermere. Mary's history is briefly as follows:- She was the daughter of the innkeeper, whose house was not a little indebted for its custom to the attractions of Mary. Of course she had many wooers, but rejected them all in favour of a man named Hatfield, who gave himself out to be Colonel Hope. This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged. Poor May remained an interesting young widow in her native valley for some time after this, and became famous in consequence of the reports of tourists regarding her beauty; but ultimately she became unromantic enough to marry a respectable farmer of Calbeck.
