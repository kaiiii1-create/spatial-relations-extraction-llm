He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the



mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.



THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view.

Anon1857_b.xml,2,"With the carefully prepared map attached to this guide, the tourist will experience no difficulty in tracing the main route and the diverging excursions here laid down; and a very little consideration, with the aid of occasional inquiry as to minutiæ when on the spot, will enable him to vary his proceedings according to inclination. He will farther be very much aided in these investigations by observing the distinct markings on the map which include bridle-paths and carriage-roads. In a tour of this description we believe that minute detail in regard to every possible route is unnecessary, and would only prove perplexing. We conceive that the



mere mention of all the places and objects of interest, with one good route to the most of them, and a slight indication of others, is all that is required. This we have attempted to give in these pages, and we trust that the traveller will find the volume sufficiently explicit, while the beautiful engravings with which it is embellished will enable him in some degree to anticipate the scenery he is about to visit.



THERE is, perhaps, no part of Great Britain more beautiful and picturesque, more varied in its scenery, or more calculated to afford intense gratification to the tourist, - whether he travels as a man of science, as a painter, or simply as an admirer of the works of his Creator, - than the Lake District of England. It is rich in flowers, rare plants, and luxuriant undergrowth. Its numerous mountains present a tempting field of investigation to the geologist. Its ruins and several very curious Roman and Druidical remains furnish points of interest to the antiquarian, while its woods and streams are associated with the names of many of our greatest poets. Its scenery presents every variety of landscape, from the weather-beaten mountain crags and peaks, the brawling rivulets, and the wild ravines of the highlands, to the outspread lakes, the cottages, and level cultivated plains of the valleys - and in the picturesque effects of light and shade, caused by the changeful nature of its skies, the varied and happy combination of its parts, and the richness of its colouring, it is pre-eminently beautiful. Contained within an area of not more than fifty miles in diameter, the lakes, and all the points of interest in their vicinity, may be visited in a short space of time; and owing to the comparatively small scale of the scenery, the mind of the traveller is kept constantly on the qui vive by the multitude of ever-varying and lovely objects presented in his view. Amid the wild and magnificent scenery of the Scotch Highlands, and, much



more, among the mountains and vales of Switzerland and Norway, the traveller, - albeit fulfilled with admiration at the majestic objects of nature around him, - is so completely lost in the immensity of space, and, in consequence of the magnitude of things, is frequently so long confined to one slowly shifting scene, that he entirely loses those softer feelings of placid delight which are aroused by the contemplation of equally wild and picturesque scenery on a reduced scale. The lakes, therefore, of the mountain regions of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, although not to be compared in magnitude or sublimity with the places before mentioned, are nevertheless possessed of charms to which the others cannot lay claim, besides having the additional advantage of being easy of access from almost any part of the kingdom.

Should this deviation be made, it will be necessary to return by the same road to Pooley Bridge, where there are two small inns, at which boats, for an excursion on the water, or for fishing, may be procured if desired. A fine view may be had from the top of Dunmallet, on which are the vestiges of a Roman fort. There is some good fishing here in the lake and stream. Trout, perch, and eels, are numerous, and large lake-trout are sometimes, though seldom, taken. Lowther Castle, the seat of the Earl of Lonsdale, is distant from this bridge about four miles. Ulleswater is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by Hallen Fell, on the western shore. The second is ter-



minated by Stybarrow Crag on the east, with Helvellyn towering in the distance behind it, and Birk Fell on the west. The third reach is decidedly the most beautiful, being surrounded by towering mountains, and studded with little islands, which, combined with the woods and rich vegetation, present a magnificent scene. The view in our engraving is taken from Birk Fell, having Stybarrow Crag on the right. After leaving Pooley Bridge, the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of Watermillock, it improves rapidly.

The view here is exceedingly fine, and when lighted up by the slanting rays of the sun, and glowing in the garb and glory of an autumnal evening, it must be quite magnificent. From this point, however, the view of Brothers Water is somewhat distant. The lake is a large tarn, deriving its name from the circumstance of two brothers having been drowned there. Before leaving this scene, much enjoyment may be derived from a visit to the beautiful valley of Deepdale, which runs up into the mountains from Bridge End, two miles from Patterdale.



Just beyond this bridge is a splendid view of the surrounding country.

The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it.

The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it. Strangers are allowed to land and walk among the groves and woods with which abounds, and, as plants and underwood are luxuriant, it presents a rich field of research to the botanist. From its upper end the prospect is very fine, embracing the head of the lake with its bays and wooded promontories; its islands and its back ground of mountains, - the Kentmore range, High Street, Wansfield Pike, Hill-Bell, Fairfield and Rydal Nab.

Anon1857_b.xml,26,"And Grasmere, now claim our attention. The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage. From Rydal Mount, a footpath passes under Knab Scar, and rejoins the main road at White Moss Quarry. From this walk many charming views may be had of the scenery around Rydal Lake, which is eminently beautiful. Near White Moss Quarry, there are two old roads to",Grasmere,claim,our attention

About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere.

There are about 2000 inhabitants in the town, who are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the linsey-woolsey stuffs and black lead pencils, the lead for which is procured in the mines of Borrowdale. The chief points of interest in and near the town are, the town-hall, erected in 1813; the parish church, upwards of half a mile distant, in which lie the remains of Dr. Southey; and the new church, an elegant building, standing on an eminence at the south end of the town, which commands a fine view of the surrounding country. There are two museums, kept by Messrs. Crosthwaite and Hutton, which ought to be visited, as they contain many curiosities and interesting specimens of the products of the neighbourhood. There is a remarkably fine model of the lake district, exhibited by its ingenious constructor, which deserves a visit, as it is wonderfully minute and correct, and coloured according to nature. It is on the scale of three inches to the mile. There is an old bell here, which has the letters H. D. R. O. 1001, stamped on it.

There are about 2000 inhabitants in the town, who are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of the linsey-woolsey stuffs and black lead pencils, the lead for which is procured in the mines of Borrowdale. The chief points of interest in and near the town are, the town-hall, erected in 1813; the parish church, upwards of half a mile distant, in which lie the remains of Dr. Southey; and the new church, an elegant building, standing on an eminence at the south end of the town, which commands a fine view of the surrounding country. There are two museums, kept by Messrs. Crosthwaite and Hutton, which ought to be visited, as they contain many curiosities and interesting specimens of the products of the neighbourhood. There is a remarkably fine model of the lake district, exhibited by its ingenious constructor, which deserves a visit, as it is wonderfully minute and correct, and coloured according to nature. It is on the scale of three inches to the mile. There is an old bell here, which has the letters H. D. R. O. 1001, stamped on it. Great Hall, the residence of the late Dr. Southey, stands on an eminence not far from the town.

It is about three miles long by upwards of a mile broad, and lies within an amphitheatre of rocky, broken, picturesque mountains and precipices, whose peaks, lights, shadows, and wooded eminences are reflected from waters of peculiar clearness and considerable depth. Its surface is adorned by several islands, which are thickly wooded, and add greatly to the beauty of the scene. The chief of these are, Lord's Island, near the shore under Wallow Crag, which formerly belonged to the family of the Ratcliffes, Earls of Derwentwater; Vicar's Island, near the foot of the lake, which belongs to Captain Henry, whose residence stands on it; St. Herbert's Isle, in the centre, so called from a hermit who had his cell on it, and lived there in the seventh century; and Ramp's Holm. There is also here a singular floating island, which rises to the surface at intervals, and then sinks again. It varies in size, is covered with vegetation, and appeared last in 1842. It is supposed that its rise to the surface is caused by accumulation of gas formed by the decomposition of vegetable matter.

From the top of the cascade there is a very fine view of Derwentwater and Skiddaw. When flooded by rains, and swelled by the tributary waters of a thousand mountain rills, Lodore becomes truly magnificent. The tremendous roar of the rushing water, as it dashes from rock to rock, and leaps in white foam impetuously along its rugged course, is so loud, that it can be heard at a distance of nine or ten miles, in calm weather. Those who possess an adventurous spirit will find the rocky scenery in this neighbourhood worthy of being clambered over, even at the risk of a few sprains and bruises!

This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged.

There are extensive slate quarries in this rock, the face of which is excavated into tiers of caverns for a considerable height. Buttermere is a small lake, about a mile and a half in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth. In form it is oblong, and sweeps round



a promontory at one end. The scenery around it is grand. Its eastern side is well wooded, while on the western side a long range of mountain slopes stretch from end to end, terminating everywhere precipitously in water. At the bottom of the valley, Sour-milk-Gill falls down the steep mountains, appearing like a thread of silver on their dark sides. The mountains that surround the lake - High Crag, High Stile, Red Pike, &c. - almost overshadow its waters, and give to it a somewhat gloomy appearance, which is not a little heightened by the comparative want of cultivation and human habitations.

One route is by Borrowdale, over Styhead; another is as follows:- Proceed past Scale Hill, by any of the routes before mentioned, to Lowes Water, and thence to Lampleugh Cross and Ennerdale Bridge. Thence to Calder Bridge, where there are two good inns, and on to Gosforth and the Strands in Wastdale; but this route is very circuitous. Wast Water is three miles in length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth, and the scenery around it is rugged and less attractive than that of most of the other lakes, from which circumstance, and the difficulty of access to it, it is seldom visited. There is nothing very striking in the features and character of Ennerdale Lake, though it is not without its beauties; but, after the romantic and superb scenery which the tourist has already passed, we would recommend him to rest satisfied with the view of those lakes that is to be had from the various mountain tops he may have scaled during his progress through the Lake District -",Wast Water,is,three miles in length
