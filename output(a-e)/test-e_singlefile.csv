Ulleswater is nine miles in length, by nearly a mile wide, at the broadest point; but, owing to its irregular form, it is divided into three reaches, the first of which is closed in by Hallen Fell, on the western shore.

The view in our engraving is taken from Birk Fell, having Stybarrow Crag on the right. After leaving Pooley Bridge, the scenery, for the first three or four miles, is comparatively tame; but after passing the village of Watermillock, it improves rapidly.

Anon1857_b.xml,13,"This is the largest of all the English lakes, but the character of the scenery is not so grand as that of the others. The visitor is, therefore, in danger of being disappointed if he be not prepared for a much softer - but to some minds not less pleasing - style of scenery than that through which he has already passed. The landscape generally is characterized more by grace and richness than by grandeur. Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it. Strangers are allowed to land and walk among the groves and woods with which abounds, and, as plants and underwood are luxuriant, it presents a rich field of research to the botanist. From its upper end the prospect is very fine, embracing the head of the lake with its bays and wooded promontories; its islands and its back ground of mountains, - the Kentmore range, High Street, Wansfield Pike, Hill-Bell, Fairfield and Rydal Nab. The islands in view are Hen Holm, and Lady Holm. There is a point just behind the Ferry Inn which ought to be visited, as a fine view of the surrounding scenery may be obtained from it.",the rivers Rothay,passes through,the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal

Measured by the road, Windermere is upwards of thirteen miles long - in a straight line it is not much more than ten miles - and about a mile broad at its widest part. There are two principal feeders to this lake, - the rivers Rothay and Brathay. The first, rising in the mountains near Wythburn, passes through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydal before entering Windermere. The second rises in a mountain range called Langdale Pikes, and unites with the Rothay near Croft Lodge, a short distance from the lake. There is a very curious and interesting circumstance connected with the fish of these rivers. As the spawning season approaches, the trout and charr ascend the stream together until they arrive at the point where the waters unite. Here they always separate; all the trout proceeding up the Rothay, while allthe charr go up the Brathay. It is difficult to conjecture the cause of this separation, but the perfectness of the understanding on both sides, and the unvarying regularity of the arrangement, would incline us to suppose that their Creator had endowed these fish with an instinct little, if at all, short of reason. Among other tributary streams is the Troutbeck, which falls into the lake near Calgarth. Its waters are discharged at Newby Bridge where they receive the name of the river Leven, which,



two miles farther on, falls into the estuary called the Leven Sands. At Bowness there is a ferry over the lake, from which a fine view of the mountains and scenery at its head is obtained. Windermere is very deep, varying from thirty to a hundred and twenty feet; and it is remarkably clear, permitting the eye to penetrate far into its depths, where the finny inhabitants gambol in shoals. Owing to its great depth heavy rains do not make any perceptible increase in its volume. At Waterhead, scarcely a mile distant, boats may be procured for excursions on the lake. These excursions, of course, will be made to various parts according to the taste of the visitors. One good route to take is along the Brathay coast, and across the lake to Low-wood Inn. The island of Belle Isle, near Bowness, is a point of interest. It is upwards of a mile in circumference, and belongs to H. Curwen Esq., who has a summer residence on it.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on



the right, is Rydal Hall, where are two picturesque falls, that ought to be seen. It is necessary to make application at the cottage near the chapel, in order to accomplish this. The lower fall is the finer of the two, and may be seen from a summerhouse in the grounds. There are some splendid trees in the park, well worth seeing. The main road beyond does not afford good views of this the smallest, but one of the most beautiful, of the English lakes. One of the few good points is Thrang Crag, through which the road is cut, a few hundred yards beyond Rydal village, on the Keswick side. On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage.

On this lake, also, is Rydal Mount, long the dwelling-place of Wordsworth. It stands on the hill called Knab Scar. From this point there are some fine views. But we cannot too strongly recommend the bridle-path, on the southern shore, to those who are anxious to see the lake, with its two little grass islets, to advantage. From Rydal Mount, a footpath passes under Knab Scar, and rejoins the main road at White Moss Quarry.

The highway to Rydal village is not more than a mile and a quarter from Ambleside; but for pedestrians, we recommend the footpath along the banks of the Rothay, under Loughrigg Fell, as being much more sylvan and agreeable. By this route the traveller proceeds along the road to Clappersgate, until he reaches Rothay Bridge; crosses this, enters the first gate on the right, and proceeds thence along the river to Pelter Bridge. About a mile is thus added to the distance. Instead of crossing the bridge, the pedestrian may, if disposed for a longer walk, keep to the left, along the road which passes behind Coat How farm, by which he will gain the southern shore of the lake, and ultimately, by a steep ascent, reach a fine terrace, which commands a magnificent view of Grasmere. It is from this point that our drawing of that lake is taken. A little farther on, the road joins the Grasmere road, which conducts to the village of that name. By the route first mentioned, the northern shore of the lake is kept, and the pretty village of Rydal is passed. Here, on

The best views of it are to be had from Crow Park, Friar's Crag, and the Vicarage. The whole vale extends almost in a straight line from the head of Derwentwater to the foot of Bassenthwaite Lake, and is connected with Borrowdale on the south, and Thirlmere on the east, while on the west is Newlands Vale. Castlehill, one mile from Keswick on the Ambleside road, and Ashness, afford good bird's-eye views, while more distant views may be had from Latrigg, Ormathwaite, Applethwaite, and Braithwaite.

In shape it bears some slight resemblance to a ship on its keel, and it is 62 feet long by 36 feet high, and 84 feet in circumference. It is estimated to weigh 1771 tons. A gentleman in the neigh-



bourhood, who thought that he could improve upon nature, committed some depredations on the native simplicity of this rock and its locality; among other things he erected a ladder against the side of the rock, to enable aspiring strangers to reach the top of it. No good was gained by this, as the view is not nearly equal to that which may be obtained from any of the adjacent heights, while the rude wooden structure spoils the rugged outline of the stone. Just opposite to Bowder Stone, Castle Crag rears its head. Its name is derived from a Roman fortress which once crowned its summit, and guarded the pass of Borrowdale. The views from this mount are grand and extensive. On one side are Derwentwater; its wooded islands, and the rich vale, speckled with human habitations, and mingled field and woodland scenery, with Skiddaw for a background.

Of course she had many wooers, but rejected them all in favour of a man named Hatfield, who gave himself out to be Colonel Hope. This man, who had fled from the arm of justice into these sequestered mountains, saw, loved, and married Mary in 1802; but not long afterwards was arrested for forgery, and carried to Carlisle, where he was tried, found guilty, and hanged.
