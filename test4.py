You are an expert in spatial language understanding.

The following paragraph is a piece of Lake District writing from the 17th to the 20th century.

Your task is to extract only spatial relationships that describe how physical locations are situated relative to one another in space — especially how spatial terms are used to depict **scenic views** of the Lake District.

A **spatial relationship** must be a (Subject, Spatial_Relation, Object) tuple, where:
- Subject and Object are **real-world physical entities**
- Spatial_Relation clearly describes the physical positioning of Subject relative to Object

 Valid examples:
    ("lake", "surrounded by", "trees")
    ("bridge", "over", "river")
    ("village", "in", "valley")
    ("road", "runs along", "shore")

 Do NOT include:
- Temporal or event-based descriptions (e.g., "visited by", "route from", "known as")
- Abstract or metaphorical relations
- Mere naming relationships
- Anything without a clear spatial keyword

Return only valid Python-style tuples, one per line. No explanation.
